# For this project, I used Spotify data from Kaggle and a table created by Charlotte Chaze.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

##First, I look at the data in the dataset

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

##1. Which artists have the highest average popularity?

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 10

##2. Which artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms) AS duration
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

##3. How many songs does Olivia Rodrigo have on this list?

SELECT COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'

##4. Which song had the lowest popularity?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, MIN(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

##5. What was the average tempo of the top 20 songs?

SELECT AVG(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 20

##6. What was the average tempo of an Olivia Rodrigo song?

SELECT AVG(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'

##7. What is the average danceability for each artist?

SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) DESC;

##8. Which 10 songs are the least energetic?

SELECT id, track_name, artist_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY energy asc
LIMIT 10

##Then I practiced using CTEs
##Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table.
##Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH average_popularity_table AS (
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) as average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM average_popularity_table
WHERE average_popularity >= 90
ORDER BY average_popularity DESC
